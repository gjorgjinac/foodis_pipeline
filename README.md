![FooDis pipeline](images/pipeline.png "Initial foodis pipeline")

The FooDis pipeline enables mining abstracts of biomedical scientific papers from Pubmed, in order to identify relations between _**food**_ and _**disease**_ entities. The entities can be associated with a _**cause**_ or a _**treat**_ relation, or there can be no association between them.
